ECE 346 - Engineering Mathematics with ECE Applications

**2024/2025 Curriculum Handbook Data**

ECE 346. Engineering Mathematics with ECE Applications. 3(1). Students will learn advanced mathematical concepts and skills required to succeed in Electrical Engineering. Topics include Discrete Mathematics, Conditional Probability, Probability Distributions, Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations, Laplace and Fourier Analysis methods, Linear Algebra, Vector Calculus. The course will provide applications of these techniques commonly used in higher levels of the ECE discipline, and will include both analytical and numerical approaches to each of these topics. Final exam. Prereq: Math 243 and Math 245. Sem Hrs: 3 Fall.

**Course Prerequisites by Topic**

1. Multivariable Calculus (vector calculus). \[Math 243\]
2. Ordinary Differential Equations. \[Math 245\].

**Additional Topical Requirements**

None

**Course Goals**

Cadets completing ECE 346 should be able to recognize and apply mathematical methods to model and develop solutions for a variety of problems engineering practice. Specifically, they should develop the mathematical abilities to succeed in advanced Electrical Engineering courses.

# Course Objectives

Cadets shall be able to:

1. Apply certain aspects of discrete mathematics (graph theory, modulo math) to solve ECE problems.
2. Apply discrete and continuous probability concepts to ECE problems.
3. Solve linear and nonlinear systems using ODEs and apply them to specific ECE problems.
4. Use Laplace and Fourier analysis to solve linear and nonlinear ECE problems.
5. Model physical systems using PDEs and use separation of variables to solve PDE systems and interpret the solutions.
6. Use fundamental linear algebra techniques to solve ECE problems, including eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
7. Apply concepts of vector calculus to integration over curves and surfaces. Use integral calculus to obtain new types of integrals or transform them into one another.

## Course Director’s Subjective Assessment

In the Course Report at the end of the semester, the Course Director will assign a subjective score on a scale of one to ten to assess the delivery and accomplishments of the course. This evaluation will assess each of the following areas:

- Were objectives met using the above assessment methods and success criteria?
- Was the course flow appropriate (order of topics, time spent on each topic, scope of GRs, etc)?
- Cadet feedback via formal critiques and informal comments.
- Instructor observations
- Was instructor effort consistent with the student learning achievements?
- Was integration of course activities (homework, quizzes, GRs, labs, presentations, etc.) appropriate for the objectives?
- Were any unique or novel pedagogical approaches employed and, if so, were they beneficial?

Scale Definitions:

10 - no adjustments are necessary

9 - only administrative changes are required

8 - a few minor changes are needed in one or two areas

7 - minor changes in many areas

6 - a major change in some area

5 or less - more than one major change is needed to improve the course.

Engineering Topics: 2.25 Sem Hrs or 75%

Mathematics and Basic Science: 0.75 Sem Hrs or 25%
